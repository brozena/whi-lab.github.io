title: Intervention Delivery for Patients with PTSD

There are well-established associations between PTSD and intimate relationship
problems [13, 14]. A negative or unsupportive interpersonal milieu can impede
recovery from PTSD, even when patients receive state-of-the-art individual
therapy for PTSD [15, 16]. Recent studies show that family interventions (e.g.,
couple therapy) can improve patient outcomes in PTSD. For example, Cognitive-Behavioral
Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) for PTSD [3] has been shown to significantly decrease
PTSD symptom severity as well as improving relationship functioning
[3, 11, 12].

However, effective integration of this modality in routine clinical
care settings poses some serious logistical challenges. Specifically, it is
resource intensive and require specialized training, 10â€“15 visits to mental health
centers, and long clinical sessions (i.e., over 1 hour). Collectively, these
issues result in significant barriers to receiving and continuing treatments.
Indeed, many patients with PTSD remain untreated [4]. Furthermore, there is also
a shortage of qualified personnel who can provide these treatment steps to the
patients. In this project, we focus on these scalability and accessibility issues
for providing PTSD care to patients across society. The key challenge we aim to
address here is thus: how can we scale up a clinically validated treatment method
for PTSD so that it can be effectively delivered to patients whenever and wherever
they need it?

Towards this, we aim to develop smart-home conversational agents using Amazon
Alexa for the delivery of CBCT treatment steps. Recently, smartphone applications
have been used to deliver psychoeducation and monitor symptoms. However, smartphone
is an intimate and personal device and as such, it might not be appropriate for
family interventions including CBCT. Amazon Alexa, on the other hand, enables
us to leverage the shared and collaborative aspects of family and home
environments for interactive, personalized, and timely delivery of CBCT steps.
Such a conversational agent can be deployed into any compatible smart-home devices
(e.g., Amazon Echo) facilitating wide-scale dissemination of evidence-based
treatment steps.
