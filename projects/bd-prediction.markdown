Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by extreme fluctuations in
mood, energy, and cognition resulting in manic and depressive
episodes. There is no cure for BD; traditional treatment steps
involve lifelong illness management and constant vigilance against
relapse. Indeed, preventing relapse is a key clinical focus since
it results in better patient outcomes, improves quality of life,
and reduces the need for hospitalization1 — a major source of
national health care cost.

Mania and depression episodes are often accompanied by behavioral
anomalies and significant changes in social interactions. Hyperactivity,
decreased need of sleep, being more talkative, and irritability
often precedes mania; symptoms including low energy, hypersomnia,
and lack of interest are common before a depressive episode2.
Identifying and managing these early symptoms is crucial to prevent
and minimize the impact of relapse in BD. However, current clinical
methods for detecting early-warning signs are inadequate for granular
and long-term monitoring.

Our social relationships and behavioral routines are now often
embedded in online activities. We use mails and social media to
communicate and collaborate, type into search engines to retrieve
information, and utilize online shopping services to buy things.
This is true for individuals with serious mental illnesses as well
— approximately 81% of patients with BD use online technologies.
Online activities provide unique insights into behavior and social
interactions, and thus could be used to identify early- warning
signs in BD.

In this project, we aim to address this gap. Our key goal here is
to develop a prediction framework that will identify behavioral
anomalies and early-warning signs in BD using continuous streams
of online behavioral data. Towards this goal, we are collecting online
activity data (e.g., email, social media, and search queries) as
well as clinical history from patients with BD. This will enable
us to associate personalized trends and changes in online activities
with illness states — leading to a computational framework to
identify early-warning signs in BD.
