The Wellbeing & Health Innovation (WHI) lab is affiliated with the
[College of Information Sciences and Technology][ist-link] at Penn
State.

In the WHI lab, we develop novel HCI and UbiComp technologies to
improve health and wellbeing at scale. Our research leverages
mobile phones, sensors, and online data to passively model health
behaviors and contexts. We also design data-driven and just-in-time
interventions with a focus on sustained engagement.

Our research spreads across several application domains including
passive sensing of [sleep and circadian disruption][sleep], relapse
detection in [bipolar disorder][bd-prediction], and using Amazon
Alexa for effective [PTSD interventions][alexa-ptsd]. Our work is
inherently interdisciplinary â€” we closely collaborate with teams
from the [College of Health and Human Development][hhd], [Hershey
Medical Center][hershey-psychiatry], and [College of Communications][comm].
