The Wellbeing & Health Innovation (WHI) lab is affiliated with the
[College of Information Sciences and Technology][ist-link] at Penn State.

In WHI lab, we aim to improve health and wellbeing _at a scale_ using novel
technologies. Our research leverages mobile phones, ubiquitous sensors, and
online data to passively model health behavior and contexts.
We also develop data-driven and just-in-time interventions with a
focus on sustained engagement.

Our research spreads across several application domains including
passive sensing of [sleep and circadian disruption][sleep],
relapse detection in [bipolar disorder][bd-prediction], and
using Amazon Alexa for effective [PTSD interventions][alexa-ptsd]. Our work is
inherently interdisciplinary â€” we closely collaborate with teams
from [College of Health and Human Development][hhd],
[Hershey Medical Center][hershey-psychiatry], and
[College of Communications][comm].
